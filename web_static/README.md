                                            AirBnB Clone - Front End Development
## Project Overview
    Now that you have a command interpreter for managing your AirBnB objects, it’s time to make them alive!
    Before developing a big and complex web application, we will build the front end step-by-step. The first step is to “design” / “sketch” / “prototype” each element:

##Create simple HTML static pages
    Style guide
    Fake contents
    No data loaded from anything
    During this project, you will learn how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages. HTML is the structure of your page; it should be the first thing to write. CSS is the     styling of your page, the design. I really encourage you to fix your HTML part before starting the styling. Indeed, without any structure, you can’t apply any desig    n.

## How to Use the Webstatic

    To use the static web files in the `webstatic` directory, follow these steps:

    1. **Navigate to the Webstatic Directory**:
        Open a terminal and navigate to the `webstatic` directory within your project:
         cd AirBnB_clone/webstatic

    2. Open the HTML File:
        Open index.html in your web browser. You can do this directly from the file explorer or by using a command:

    3. View the Static Page:
        Once opened in the browser, you will see the static page as designed. This page will not have any dynamic content or Javascript functionality.
